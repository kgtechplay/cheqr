# Issues Found and Fixed in Cheqr Project

## Summary
This document outlines all the issues found during code review and the fixes applied.

## Issues Identified

### 1. ✅ **Import Mismatch in Flutter App**
**Issue**: `lib/screens/home_screen.dart` was importing `api_service.dart` but the actual file is named `api_services.dart`

**Fix**: Updated import statement from `../services/api_service.dart` to `../services/api_services.dart`

**Location**: `lib/screens/home_screen.dart:2`

---

### 2. ✅ **Missing dispose() Method**
**Issue**: `HomeScreen` class had a `TextEditingController` but no `dispose()` method to clean up resources

**Fix**: Added `dispose()` method to properly dispose of the controller

**Location**: `lib/screens/home_screen.dart:16-20`

---

### 3. ✅ **Missing FastAPI Dependencies**
**Issue**: `requirements.txt` was missing essential dependencies for the FastAPI backend server

**Fix**: Added the following dependencies:
- `fastapi` - Web framework
- `uvicorn` - ASGI server
- `pydantic` - Data validation

**Location**: `requirements.txt`

---

### 4. ✅ **Poor Project Structure**
**Issue**: Python backend files were in the root directory instead of a dedicated `backend/` folder

**Fix**: 
- Created `backend/` directory
- Moved `checker.py`, `search_results.py`, `break_statement.py` to `backend/`
- Created new `backend/main.py` with proper imports
- Created `backend/__init__.py` to make it a package
- Created `start_backend.py` for easy server startup

---

### 5. ✅ **Backend Import Issues**
**Issue**: Backend files were using relative imports incorrectly

**Fix**: Updated imports in `backend/checker.py` to use relative imports (`. import`)
Updated `backend/main.py` to import from the `backend` package properly

**Location**: 
- `backend/checker.py:1-2`
- `backend/main.py:7`

---

## Additional Improvements Made

1. **Created start script**: `start_backend.py` for easy backend server startup
2. **Fixed import paths**: All backend imports now properly reference the backend package
3. **Added root endpoint**: Backend now has a health check endpoint at `/`

## Recommendations

1. **Environment Variables**: Consider using a `.env` file loader for backend config
2. **Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling in the API service
3. **Testing**: Add unit tests for backend functions
4. **CORS Security**: Update CORS settings for production (currently allows all origins)
5. **API Documentation**: Consider adding OpenAPI/Swagger docs to the FastAPI app
6. **Logging**: Add proper logging to the backend services

## Files Modified

- `lib/screens/home_screen.dart` - Fixed import and added dispose()
- `requirements.txt` - Added FastAPI dependencies  
- Created `backend/` directory structure
- Created `start_backend.py` - Backend startup script
- Modified backend imports for proper package structure

## Testing Status

⚠️ **Note**: The backend server has not been tested yet. You should:
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Start the server: `python start_backend.py`
3. Test the API endpoint
4. Run Flutter app to test integration
